### LOOKING AT WOMEN-LIKE PRODUCT ###
# wom <- c("LADIESWEAR", "SHEER HOSIERY", "BATH AND SHOWER", "LADIES SOCKS", "BEAUTY")
Those seem to have the theme "women" in common

- With all, 25 has most with 36 and 40 slightly behind
- with only Beauty, type 36 has most counts. 40 Comes next

- With "LADIESWEAR", "SHEER HOSIERY", "LADIES SOCKS", 25 is nearly isolated
	- Other TripTypes are way less, which might suggest that those were bought for somebody else
- Fri~Sun have more visits. Might indicate school or working position
- Almost all ScanCounts are <= 2, which indicates that they are not retailers
*** 25 might by LADY category ***
- Looking at only 25, MENS WEAR was the most bought category
*** UPDATE 25 MIGHT BE MOM ***
